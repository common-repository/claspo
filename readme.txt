### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Targeting Triggers for Personalized CX###
You can configure the widget placement on your website and set display conditions without needing developers.

**Identifying Newcomers**

Showcase widgets exclusively to new visitors. Welcome newcomers with a special offer, encourage them to subscribe to your newsletter, or introduce them to your company or product with an engaging video.

**Geotargeting**

Ensure your message reaches the right audience in the right place. Tailor your widgets to specific audiences ‚Äî from entire countries to regions and even cities. 

[youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmoCqcqcq9g]

**UTM-targeting**

Set widgets to display based on UTM tags. 

*Example:* a rule will trigger a specific pop-up with a relevant offer if a person visits your website through an email, social media campaign or PPC ad banner with a specific UTM tag. This personalization enhances the user experience and increases the likelihood that the visitor will convert into a buyer. 

###  5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Rules for Non Intrusive Popup Display ###
Great deals and valuable content are key, but bombarding visitors with them can backfire. To avoid this, Claspo offers high-end approaches.

**Silence Interval**

Be sure that your visitors can focus on your content without feeling overwhelmed.

* The default time gap between widget displays in Claspo is 3 minutes.
* Easily adjust it based on typical user behavior on your site ensuring a smooth browsing experience.

**Overlapping Protection**

Managing multiple widgets can be complicated. Claspo's automatic overlapping protection eliminates the worry of them clashing on your visitors' screens, even if you duplicate display rules for several widgets by mistake.

**Step 1: Select the Perfect Template**

Choose a ready-made template or create one from scratch. Using a template will save you time and give you confidence in the quality of your design. Using filters such as use-case, layout, industry, and theme, you can choose the template that best suits your purpose.

**Step 2: Customize the Template for Your Brand**

Choose a color scheme that matches your brand book or website style. Write text and change images by adding your own or selecting from our library.

**Step 3: Set the Rules for Displaying the Widget**

The optimal rules for displaying pop-ups are set in the system by default. However, you can customize them to meet your specific needs and objectives. For example, choose to show the widget only to newcomers or residents of a selected city, etc.

**Step 4: Integrate Claspo with Marketing Automation Software**

For example, you can add integration with your ESP with a couple of clicks. Copy a single line of code from our system and add it to the admin panel of your email marketing automation platform. You won't need this step for all your future widgets.

**Step 5: Publish it!**

You can test drive the completed widget without publishing it on your website. If everything is fine, publish it and track conversions and revenue!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

# What's Included in the Free Claspo Plan?
Claspo's fair free plan provides everything you need to get started with pop-ups on your website:

* Three active widgets. You can create and use up to three pop-up widgets on your website at any given time. This allows you to test different pop-up designs and target them to specific audiences.
* 30,000 pageviews per month. This is suitable for new websites and those with moderate traffic. If you exceed this limit, you can purchase additional pageviews without upgrading your plan.
* Access to Claspo‚Äôs full range of features and templates. 

# How are Pageviews Calculated?
Pageviews refer to the number of times a user visits the pages where the Claspo script is installed.

The Claspo tracking module counts a pageview whenever a page is loaded or the URL path (the segments before the question mark) changes. For instance, if a user navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, each visit is counted as a separate pageview. Additionally, if a user reloads a page, it counts as an additional pageview.

However, a pageview is not counted when only the query component of a page URL changes (the part after the question mark). For example, if a user applies or changes filters on your page and the URL path remains the same, this does not count as a new pageview.

# Is There an Expiration Date on the Free Plan?
No! Claspo's free plan is truly free for life. There are no hidden fees or time constraints. You can use it for as long as it meets your needs. 

Whether you're a solo entrepreneur just starting out or a small business looking to test the waters of pop-up marketing, the free plan is a great place to begin. It allows you to experiment with Claspo's features and see the positive impact pop-ups can have on your website's performance at your own pace. 

If your website grows or you need more advanced features, you can always upgrade to a paid plan later.

# How Can I Save Money on Claspo‚Äôs Paid Plans?
Claspo rewards your commitment! Choose the annual plan and get 2 extra months of service free.

# Can I Cancel My Subscription?
Yes, you can! Claspo offers full flexibility. You can cancel your subscription anytime from within your account settings.

# How Does Claspo Handle User Data?
This plugin utilizes the [Claspo](https://claspo.io) service to enhance your website's user experience by enabling features such as popups for email capture, lead generation, notifications, and surveys. Claspo provides a platform for creating and managing these web widgets.

To understand how Claspo handles user data collected on your website, please refer to our [Data Processing Agreement](https://claspo.io/data-processing-agreement/), [Terms of Use](https://claspo.io/terms-of-use/), and [Privacy Policy](https://claspo.io/privacy-policy/).
